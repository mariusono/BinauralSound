# BinauralSound
An audio plugin for binaural sound. Moves a mono sound source around a 1 meter sphere around the listener's head.

Implements a combination of the papers: "An efficient HRTF model for 3-D sound" and "A Structural Model for Binaural Sound Synthesis" both written by Brown and Duda. 

User can change the location of the sound source by changing the azimuth and elevation sliders. Azimuth controls the angle of the sound source with the median plane and the elevation controls the angle wrt. the horizontal .
